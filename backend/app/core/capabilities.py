"""Commerce capability layer.

A single, declarative place that answers: *what can be done with this
commerce entity?* Capabilities are inferred from the entity's own data
(fields that already exist in the schema) rather than hardcoded at each call
site, so the rule lives in one location and new entity kinds slot in without
touching the checkout/booking code.

Current mapping (derived from the actual models):
- ``Product``  → ORDERABLE   (has ``price`` + participates in OrderItem)
- ``Service``  → BOOKABLE     (has ``pricing_type`` + drives BookingV2)

The design is intentionally extensible: an entity may declare *more than one*
capability (e.g. a future product that also needs on-site installation would
be both ORDERABLE and BOOKABLE). Nothing here mutates data or touches the DB;
it only reads attributes, so it is safe to call from any layer.
